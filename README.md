This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the npm dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Next, copy the `.env.local.example` file as `.env.local` in the root of your project and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` variable to your site's public URL:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
